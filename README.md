Handwritten digit classification is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision, serving as a benchmark for many classification algorithms. It involves recognizing and classifying the digits (0-9) from images of handwritten digits. One of the most famous datasets used for this task is the MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits.
